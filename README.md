Lightweight full-stack tool that analyzes uploaded resumes against a job description using OpenAI to provide a numeric match score along with strengths and suggested improvements. The project contains an Express.js backend (with MongoDB) and a Vite + React frontend.

## What it does

AI Resume Analyzer accepts a user-uploaded resume (PDF or DOCX) and a job description, extracts resume text, sends both to OpenAI, and stores the returned analysis (score, strengths, improvements) in MongoDB for later viewing.

## Why it’s useful

- Quickly evaluate how well a resume matches a job description.
- Get human-readable strengths and targeted improvements generated by an LLM.
- Stores analyses for audit, sharing, or improvement tracking.

## Key features

- Resume parsing (PDF, DOCX)
- AI-powered scoring & feedback via OpenAI
- Simple user auth (signup/login) and protected endpoints
- Basic React frontend to upload resumes and view results

## Getting started

These instructions get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (recommended v18+)
- npm (or yarn)
- MongoDB running locally or a connection string to a MongoDB service
- An OpenAI API key for resume analysis

### Backend setup

1. Open a terminal and install backend deps:

```powershell
cd Backend
npm install
```

2. Environment

- Create a `.env` file in `Backend/` with at least the following variable:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
# (optional) if you change code to read these, consider adding:
# MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/ai-resume-analyzer
# JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

Note: The included `Backend/config/db.js` currently connects to `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/ai-resume-analyzer` by default. If you prefer an env-based URI, update `config/db.js` to use an environment variable (MONGO_URI) or replace the string with your connection string.

3. Start the backend server:

```powershell
cd Backend
npm start
```

The server listens on port 5000 by default and exposes these primary routes:

- POST /api/auth/signup — register a new user
- POST /api/auth/login — login and receive a JWT
- POST /api/resume/upload — protected; upload resume and jobDescription (multipart/form-data)

### Frontend setup

1. Install dependencies and run dev server:

```powershell
cd Frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. The frontend uses `src/api.js` which points to `http://localhost:5000/api` by default — change this if you run the backend on another host/port.

### Run the app (dev)

1. Start MongoDB (if needed).
2. Start backend (`Backend/npm start`).
3. Start frontend (`Frontend/npm run dev`).
4. Open the frontend URL from Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Usage examples

Signup / Login (example payloads)

```http
POST /api/auth/signup
Content-Type: application/json

{
	"name": "Alice",
	"email": "alice@example.com",
	"password": "securepassword"
}
```

```http
POST /api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
	"email": "alice@example.com",
	"password": "securepassword"
}
```

Uploading a resume (curl example)

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/resume/upload" \
	-H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>" \
	-F "resume=@/path/to/resume.pdf" \
	-F "jobDescription=Looking for a full stack engineer with Node and React"
```

The backend will respond with the created Resume document including the analysis returned by OpenAI.

## Configuration & environment

Important runtime values:

- OPENAI_API_KEY — required to use OpenAI (set in `Backend/.env` or environment)
- MongoDB — the project expects a local MongoDB instance by default at `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/ai-resume-analyzer` (see `Backend/config/db.js`)
- JWT secret — the default code uses `jwtsecret` hardcoded; consider setting and using a real secret in production and updating `authMiddleware.js` and `authRoutes.js` accordingly.

Security note: Do not commit your `.env` or API keys. Use a secrets manager or environment variables in production.

## Where to get help

- Open an issue in this repository for bugs or feature requests.
- Review code in `Backend/` and `Frontend/` to find implementation details.
- For questions about OpenAI usage or quota, consult OpenAI docs.

## Who maintains & how to contribute

Maintainers: repository contributors (check the Git history for author information).

Contributing guidelines (short):

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch (feature/your-change).
2. Open a descriptive pull request against the main branch.
3. Keep changes focused and add tests where appropriate.
4. Use clear commit messages and run linters (frontend uses ESLint).

If you plan to contribute regularly, consider adding a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to the repository with more detailed instructions.
